# Password Generator

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Join to the correct path of the clone
3. Execute: `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Execute: `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`

## Description

I made a web page that allows the user to generate a random password. From this generated password you can choose: its length, if it contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and/or symbols. It is a very customizable password generator.
